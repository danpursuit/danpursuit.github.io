## Summary

This project puts my MERN stack knowledge and Stable Diffusion creative abilities to the test! My vision is to create a multiplayer online game that
involves real time strategy and coherent, fantasy graphics. I also wanted to give the UI a Pokemon Showdown style feel, where the player can join a lobby
to chat with other players, send friendly challenges, and spectate games. This is my capstone project for my Javascript learning--tying everything I've learned together in one beautiful
application

## Project Specs
- Create a site with a Navbar, a Character Select page, and a Welcome page
- Allow Battles and Chat Rooms to be opened up as extra tabs, and create a tab UI to allow for switching and closing tabs
- Allow users to create a Username to find battles/chat/record scores, and allow users to later attach a password to their account
- Create the actual gameplay!
  - Gameplay revolves around searching through a variety of spells and casting them to beat your opponent. Create a search bar with intelligent autocomplete and
intuitive navigation through typing, arrow keys, numbers, tab, and enter.
  - Display character sprites, stat bars, and equipment. Add animations to spice up the actions
  - Use proper state management across clients and server
- Create CPUs with prebuilt strategies for single player games
- Using my own creative tools (Stable Diffusion AI and GIMP for editing), generate *all* graphics for the game! Including characters, equipment, logos, and
backgrounds.


## Process
This is the largest project I've undertaken by myself. In total I built about 40 React components, synthesized 50 game sprites, 
and created 10 pieces of equipment and 13 spells!

Time spent on project: 200 hours over 40 days. Whew!
